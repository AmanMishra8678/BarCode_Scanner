# Barcode Decoder

This Python script decodes barcodes using the `pyzbar` library. It captures frames from a camera (or video stream) and identifies barcodes within those frames.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- `pyzbar` library (for barcode decoding)

## Installation

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python-headless pyzbar
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python barcode_reader.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Connect a camera or provide a video stream.
2. Run the script.
3. Point the camera at a barcode.
4. The script will display the barcode type and data.

## Code Explanation

- The `decode` function processes the captured frames and decodes any detected barcodes.
- The `draw_barcode` function draws a rectangle around the detected barcode.
- The main loop captures frames, decodes barcodes, and displays the result.

## Example Output

```
Type: EAN13
Data: 123456789012
```
